## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project is organized into a clear Backend/Frontend separation:

```text
.
├── backend/                # FastAPI Backend
│   ├── main.py             # Server logic & Gemini integration
│   ├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
│   └── .env                # Gemini API Key (keep secure!)
├── frontend/               # Plain HTML/CSS/JS Frontend
│   ├── index.html          # Structure
│   ├── style.css           # Styling
│   └── script.js           # Frontend logic
├── Dockerfile              # Docker image definition
├── docker-compose.yml      # Local orchestration
└── .github/workflows/      # CI/CD Pipeline
```

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 🚀 Getting Started (FastAPI + HTML/CSS)
**Local Development:**
1. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add your Gemini API Key to `.env`
4. Run the server: `python main.py`

**Frontend:**
1. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser.
2. Ensure the `API_BASE_URL` in `script.js` matches your backend URL.

### 🐳 Docker Deployment
1. **Build the image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t rashedulalbab1234/global-math-solver:latest .
   ```
2. **Run with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   *Note: Ensure your `.env` file is in `backend/` as it will be loaded by the container.*

### ☁️ Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces (Free & Easy)
1. **Create an Account**: Go to [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/) and sign up.
2. **Create a New Space**:
   * Click your profile picture -> **New Space**.
   * **Name**: `global-stem-solver` (or similar).
   * **License**: MIT.
   * **SDK**: Select **Docker**.
   * **Template**: Select **Blank**.
3. **Upload Files**:
   * Upload `Dockerfile`, `backend/`, `frontend/`, `requirements.txt` via web interface or git.
4. **Add Secret**:
   * Go to **Settings** -> **Variables and secrets**.
   * New Secret -> Name: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, Value: `(Your Key)`.
5. **Done!** Your app will build and launch automatically.

### ☁️ Deploy on Render
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Log in to [Render](https://render.com/).
3. Click "New +" -> "Web Service".
4. Connect your GitHub repository.
5. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` or `Dockerfile` (if you choose Docker runtime).
6. **Important**: Add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the "Environment" tab on Render dashboard.

## 🏗️ CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
1. **Secrets required** in your GitHub repository:
   - `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`: `rashedulalbab1234`
   - `DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub Access Token.
2. The workflow triggers on every push to the `main` branch.

## 🛡️ Security & Scalability
- **Environment Variables**: API keys are stored in `.env` files and never exposed to the frontend.
- **FastAPI**: Provides a robust, asynchronous backend capable of handling multiple concurrent requests.
- **Gemini AI**: Uses the latest `gemini-2.5-flash` model for high-speed, accurate mathematical reasoning.
